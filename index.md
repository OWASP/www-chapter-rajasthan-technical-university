## Welcome
Welcome to the OWASP Rajasthan Technical University Student Chapter!  
We are a student-led community passionate about learning, sharing, and promoting best practices in application and cybersecurity. Our mission is to empower students with the knowledge and skills to secure modern applications and contribute to the global OWASP community.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All OWASP projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

Our student chapter aims to:

- Hosting hands-on workshops and Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions
- Organizing guest talks and webinars from industry experts
- Contributing to OWASP open-source projects
- Providing mentorship and guidance to students entering the field

We invite everyone, regardless of experience level, to join us. Diversity and inclusion are key values of our chapter. This is your chance to collaborate, learn, and build a reputation in the field of cybersecurity!
